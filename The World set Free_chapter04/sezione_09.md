## CHAPTER THE FOURTH. THE NEW PHASE

### Section 9

The early years of the World Republic witnessed a certain recrudescence of political adventure. There was, it israther curious to note, no revival of separatism after the face of King Ferdinand Charles had vanished from thesight of men, but in a number of countries, as the first urgent physical needs were met, there appeared a variety ofpersonalities having this in common, that they sought to revive political trouble and clamber by its aid to positionsof importance and satisfaction. In no case did they speak in the name of kings, and it is clear that monarchy musthave been far gone in obsolescence before the twentieth century began, but they made appeals to the large

survivals of nationalist and racial feeling that were everywhere to be found, they alleged with considerable justicethat the council was overriding racial and national customs and disregarding religious rules. The great plain ofIndia was particularly prolific in such agitators. The revival of newspapers, which had largely ceased during theterrible year because of the dislocation of the coinage, gave a vehicle and a method of organisation to thesecomplaints. At first the council disregarded this developing opposition, and then it recognised it with an entirelydevastating frankness.
Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government. It was of an extravagant illegality. It was, indeed,hardly more than a club, a club of about a hundred persons. At the outset there were ninety−three, and these wereincreased afterwards by the issue of invitations which more than balanced its deaths, to as many at one time asone hundred and nineteen. Always its constitution has been miscellaneous. At no time were these invitationsissued with an admission that they recognised a right. The old institution or monarchy had come out unexpectedlywell in the light of the new regime. Nine of the original members of the first government were crowned headswho had resigned their separate sovereignty, and at no time afterwards did the number of its royal members sinkbelow six. In their case there was perhaps a kind of attenuated claim to rule, but except for them and the still moreinfinitesimal pretensions of one or two ax−presidents of republics, no member of the council had even the shadeof a right to his participation in its power. It was natural, therefore, that its opponents should find a commonground in a clamour for representative government, and build high hopes upon a return, to parliamentaryinstitutions.
The council decided to give them everything they wanted, but in a form that suited ill with their aspirations. Itbecame at one stroke a representative body. It became, indeed, magnificently representative. It became sorepresentative that the politicians were drowned in a deluge of votes. Every adult of either sex from pole to polewas given a vote, and the world was divided into ten constituencies, which voted on the same day by means of asimple modification of the world post. Membership of the government, it was decided, must be for life, save inthe exceptional case of a recall; but the elections, which were held quinquenially, were arranged to add fiftymembers on each occasion. The method of proportional representation with one transferable vote was adopted,and the voter might also write upon his voting paper in a specially marked space, the name of any of hisrepresentatives that he wished to recall. A ruler was recallable by as many votes as the quota by which he hadbeen elected, and the original members by as many votes in any constituency as the returning quotas in the firstelection.
Upon these conditions the council submitted itself very cheerfully to the suffrages of the world. None of itsmembers were recalled, and its fifty new associates, which included twenty−seven which it had seen fit torecommend, were of an altogether too miscellaneous quality to disturb the broad trend of its policy. Its freedomfrom rules or formalities prevented any obstructive proceedings, and when one of the two newly arrived HomeRule members for India sought for information how to bring in a bill, they learnt simply that bills were notbrought in. They asked for the speaker, and were privileged to hear much ripe wisdom from the ex−king Egbert,who was now consciously among the seniors of the gathering. Thereafter they were baffled men....
But already by that time the work of the council was drawing to an end. It was concerned not so much for thecontinuation of its construction as for the preservation of its accomplished work from the dramatic instincts of thepolitician.
The life of the race becomes indeed more and more independent of the formal government. The council, in itsopening phase, was heroic in spirit; a dragon−slaying body, it slashed out of existence a vast, knotted tangle ofobsolete ideas and clumsy and jealous proprietorships; it secured by a noble system of institutional precautions,freedom of inquiry, freedom of criticism, free communications, a common basis of education and understanding,and freedom from economic oppression. With that its creative task was accomplished. It became more and morean established security and less and less an active intervention. There is nothing in our time to correspond with thecontinual petty making and entangling of laws in an atmosphere of contention that is perhaps the most perplexing

aspect of constitutional history in the nineteenth century. In that age they seem to have been perpetually makinglaws when we should alter regulations. The work of change which we delegate to these scientific committees ofspecific general direction which have the special knowledge needed, and which are themselves dominated by thebroad intellectual process of the community, was in those days inextricably mixed up with legislation. Theyfought over the details; we should as soon think of fighting over the arrangement of the parts of a machine. Weknow nowadays that such things go on best within laws, as life goes on between earth and sky. And so it is thatgovernment gathers now for a day or so in each year under the sunshine of Brissago when Saint Bruno's lilies arein flower, and does little more than bless the work of its committees. And even these committees are lessoriginative and more expressive of the general thought than they were at first. It becomes difficult to mark out theparticular directive personalities of the world. Continually we are less personal. Every good thought contributesnow, and every able brain falls within that informal and dispersed kingship which gathers together into onepurpose the energies of the race.
