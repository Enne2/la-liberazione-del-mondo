## CHAPTER THE SECOND. THE LAST WAR

### Section 5

A recent historical writer has described the world of that time as one that 'believed in established words and wasinvincibly blind to the obvious in things.' Certainly it seems now that nothing could have been more obvious tothe people of the earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible. And ascertainly they did not see it. They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands. Yet thebroad facts must have glared upon any intelligent mind.

These facts were before the minds of everybody; the children in the streets knewthem. And yet the world still, as the Americans used to phrase it, 'fooled around' with the paraphernalia andpretensions of war.
It is only by realising this profound, this fantastic divorce between the scientific and intellectual movement on theone hand, and the world of the lawyerâˆ’politician on the other, that the men of a later time can hope to understandthis preposterous state of affairs. Social organisation was still in the barbaric stage. There were already greatnumbers of actively intelligent men and much private and commercial civilisation, but the community, as a whole,
