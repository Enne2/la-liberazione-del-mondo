## CHAPTER THE FIFTH. THE LAST DAYS OF MARCUS KARENIN

### Section 10

Karenin desired that he might dream alone for a little while before he returned to the cell in which he was to sleep.He was given relief for a pain that began to trouble him and wrapped warmly about with furs, for a great coldnesswas creeping over all things, and so they left him, and he sat for a long time watching the afterglow give place tothe darkness of night.
It seemed to those who had to watch over him unobtrusively lest he should be in want of any attention, that hemused very deeply.
The white and purple peaks against the golden sky sank down into cold, blue remoteness, glowed out again andfaded again, and the burning cressets of the Indian stars, that even the moonrise cannot altogether quench, begantheir vigil. The moon rose behind the towering screen of dark precipices to the east, and long before it emergedabove these, its slanting beams had filled the deep gorges below with luminous mist and turned the towers andpinnacles of Lio Porgyul to a magic dreamcastle of radiance and wonder....
Came a great uprush of ghostly light above the black rim of rocks, and then like a bubble that is blown anddetaches itself the moon floated off clear into the unfathomable dark sky....
And then Karenin stood up. He walked a few paces along the terrace and remained for a time gazing up at thatgreat silver disc, that silvery shield that must needs be man's first conquest in outer space....
Presently he turned about and stood with his hands folded behind him, looking at the northward stars. . . .
At length he went to his own cell. He lay down there and slept peacefully till the morning. And early in themorning they came to him and the anaesthetic was given him and the operation performed.
It was altogether successful, but Karenin was weak and he had to lie very still; and about seven days later a bloodclot detached itself from the healing scar and travelled to his heart, and he died in an instant in the night.
